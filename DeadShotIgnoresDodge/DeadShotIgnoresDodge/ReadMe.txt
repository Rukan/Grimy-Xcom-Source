This changes the Dead Shot GTS perk to have "100 Dodge Piercing" but it does not change the crit chance bonus at all.

You can mod the crit chance separately from this mod.

This is to make it more balanced relative to Hunter's Instinct, provide a unique role for snipers, and a counter for the dodge mechanic.
